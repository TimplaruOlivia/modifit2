<h2 id="marketing" class="mt-5">Marketing</h2>

<h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
<p>This campaign promotes Modifit's standout product, a vacuum-sealed fully customizable mouthguard designed especially for female field hockey players. The campaign celebrates individuality, empowerment, and team pride while highlighting how Modifit gear enhances both performance and identity on the field. Through motivational content and community-building visuals on Instagram, we aim to grow brand awareness and foster loyalty within our audience. The campaign includes posting 3 times a week, highlighting product details and team moments, and sharing stories according to the content calendar to boost engagement. Through Instagram, we are able to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Build a consistent brand identity visually</li>
  <li>Foster direct community interaction via DM’s, comments, and polls.</li>
</ul>

<p>By April 11th, the campaign aimed to reach the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Objectives:</strong> 100 accounts reached per post</li>
  <li><strong>Response:</strong> 200-250 new followers, 30 likes per post, 5 comments</li>
  <li><strong>Behavior:</strong> Ensure that our followers feel motivated, inspired, and connected to the brand, measured via polls, DMs, or story replies</li>
</ul>

<p>The campaign is exclusively on Instagram, based on direct feedback from our target audience during interviews. The participants confirmed that Instagram is their primary platform for content, both personal and team-based which makes it the most effective channel to reach and engage with them.</p>

<h4 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
<p>Key learnings:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Make a content calendar:</strong> We learned that planning content in advance is essential for consistency, reduce stress, and smooth collaboration. This was actually our first time creating and working with a content calendar, and it proved to be one of the most valuable tools during the campaign. It helped us stay organized, meet our posting goals, and maintain a consistent brand presence on Instagram. By clearly mapping our weekly posts ahead of time and preparing them, we avoided last minute confusion and created a better flow of content.
    <br><strong>Example:</strong></li>
  <li><strong>We expected it to be easier:</strong> At the beginning of the project, we underestimated the time and effort required to produce quality content, maintaining engagement, and monitor annalistic. This proved to be more time consuming than expected and was a valuable reality check that improved our planning for the future.</li>
  <li><strong>Communication within the team:</strong> Strong communication within our team is very important. During the whole project, we communicated tasks, ideas, and updates. Due to that, our workflow was smooth and successful. We shared the workload between all of us in order to present the best content and engagement with our target audience. One key learning from this was that clear, consistent internal communication directly impact the overall success of the campaign. It helped us stay organized, avoid misunderstandings, and deliver a more unified and polished result.</li>
  <li><strong>Tools we used:</strong> Helpful tools included Canva for fast and cohesive graphic design, Instagram Insights for tracking performance, and shared documents for the content calendar. All of those tools ensured a smooth workflow, consistent branding, and clear team communication throughout the campaign.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="mt-4">What worked well:</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>The content Calendar:</strong> Because of our content calendar, we managed to publish content consistently 3 times a week as planned. This consistency helped with visibility and clear and organized planning and performance.</li>
  <li><strong>Communicating brand indentity:</strong> through consistent visuals and brand voice, we positioned our brand as a bold, feminine, team centred and sporty brand. The post and the captions that we created reflect our values and created a strong brand identity.
    <br><strong>Example:</strong> A quote from an interview with Isabel: “It is clear that it is a hockey brand, I like the name and I like the colors and I really like the pictures, especially the mouthguards, it’s giving a transparent picture of what you guys have.”</li>
  <li><strong>Nearly reaching our objectives:</strong> We didn’t hit every objective that we sat, but we came really close in most areas especially in reach, follower growth, and overall engagement. This showed us that our strategy was definitely headed in the right direction and resonated with our target audience.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Follower Growth:</strong><br>Goal: 200–250 new followers<br>Actual: 163 followers</li>
      <li><strong>Reach per Post:</strong><br>Goal: 100 accounts reached per post<br>Actual: Post reach ranged between 75 and 708 views. Most posts either met or far exceeded the goal, with some reaching over 400 accounts, which was a really encouraging result.</li>
      <li><strong>Profile Visits:</strong><br>Actual: 4,410 profile views in total</li>
      <li><strong>Post Engagement:</strong>
        <br>Goal: 30 likes and 5 comments per post
        <br><strong>Result:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Static posts: 103 likes and 13 comments across 8 posts (average of 13 likes, 1.6 comments per post)</li>
          <li>Reels: 68 likes and 4 comments across 4 reels (average of 17 likes, 1 comment per reel)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Instagram as a single platform was a strong choice:</strong> Focusing solely on Instagram made our workflow manageable and helped us target the exact platform our audience already uses daily. Based on interview feedback and performance, this was the right channel for this campaign.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="mt-4">Best-performing post:</h4>
<div class="col-md-6 p-0">
  <img src="images/corporate marketing/Picture 1.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded" style="width: 80%; margin-left: 2rem;" alt="marketing1"/>
</div>
<p>Surprisingly, our first reel turned out to be the most viewed content of the entire campaign. In this reel, we introduced our brand name using a trending sound, which likely sparked curiosity about what was coming next. Since it was the only post on our page at the time, it naturally became the main content viewers engaged with. We also noticed that reels in general tend to attract more attention from our followers. Most importantly, this post reached the highest number of non-followers, as shown in our Instagram Insights. This makes it a valuable tool for increasing brand recognition among new audiences.</p>

<h4 class="mt-4">What didn't work as well / unexpected challenges:</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Finding and creating content:</strong> one of the biggest challenges we encountered was finding good content that aligned with our brand’s tone, visual identity, and messaging. Since we didn't produce our original footage, it was difficult to fully capture the unique voice and aesthetic we aimed to present. As a result, we spent a significant amount of time searching through pre-existing visuals and editing them to match our brand’s style. While we ultimately made it work, this experience highlighted the importance of having custom, brand-specific content from the outset.</li>
  <li><strong>Timing issues:</strong> Some posts didn’t reach as many people as we wanted, which we traced back to posting during low-engagement times such as mornings and weekend. We learned that the time and day matter a lot for reach and the engagement.</li>
</ul>

<p>Example: a post we shared at 10:30 AM</p>
<div class="col-md-6 p-0">
  <img src="images/corporate marketing/Picture 4.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded" style="width: 80%; margin-left: 2rem;" alt="Why Choose Us Image"/>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Captions or CTAs that didn’t spark interaction:</strong> Some calls to action like “Comment below” or “Tag a friend” didn’t get much response.<br>
  <strong>Example:</strong> on one of our post, the caption was:<br><em>“Strong. Bold. 100% You. Our new mouthguard are here and they are designed by you!🙌🏻✨ Got an idea for the next one? Drop it below and you might score a custom mouthguard — on us!🏑🩷💚 #modifit #playwothoutlimits Let’s make gear as fierce as the players who wear it.”</em><br>Although we called for action, we got zero responds or comments. However, we believe that in the future we would have more time to create bonds with our customers, and by that we would have more interaction with them. (put this into content calander)</li>
  <li><strong>Lack of behind-the-scenes/team-generated content:</strong> One key element that was missing from our campaign was behind-the-scenes or real-life content. We did not include any footage of our team and the faces that were behind this project. Incorporating this type of content could have added a layer of authenticity and relatability to the campaign, helping followers connect with the brand on a more personal level. In future campaigns, integrating real moments will be a priority to enhance engagement and emotional connection.</li>

<p>Our latest Instagram post received the lowest views and engagement so far. Insights show it didn’t reach many new people, likely because it’s only been live for two days. Additionally, we missed opportunities by not tagging our new athlete or including a clear call to action in the caption.</p>

<h4 class="mt-4">What we would do differently</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Create our original content: Instead of relying heavily on stock photos or mockups, we would film and photograph our own content — showcasing players, team moments, and real reactions. This would boost authenticity and relatability.</li>
  <li>Show more product base images: While we did include posts featuring our product, audience feedback revealed a clear interest in seeing more detailed and informative content. Followers wanted to understand better what the product is, how it works, and how to use it in real-life scenarios. This highlighted a missed opportunity to educate our audience more thoroughly on the unique features and benefits of our vacuum-sealed, customizable mouthguard. Moving forward, placing a stronger focus on product-specific content, such as demonstration videos, feature breakdowns, and user testimonials — would not only inform but also strengthen trust and purchase intent.<br>
  <strong>Example:</strong> Quote from an interview with Fenne: “I’d like your Instagram but it doesn't really give me information about the product.”</li>
  <li>Try to reach more people: To boost reach, we would:
    <ul>
      <li>Use stronger hashtags, for example: #FemaleAthletes 394k posts, #EuroHockey 15.7k posts.</li>
      <li>Tag relevant accounts, for example: female hockey clubs, competitions, famous Athletes</li>
      <li>Follow female field hockey teams/clubs</li>
      <li>Develop themed content series for an example: “Athlete of the Week,” “Gear Tip Tuesday,” or “Custom Highlight Fridays”. This will build anticipation and routine among followers.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 class="mt-4">Final Reflection</h4>
<p>Overall was this campaign a great learning experience. Without original content, we struggled to fully capture our brand identity, but it taught us how crucial custom visuals are for authenticity. Using a content calendar for the first time helped us stay consistent and organized. Although we didn’t hit every goal, we were heading in the right direction especially for the reach and engagement. Feedback showed our visuals and tone resonated with our audience. Strong internal teamwork and communication made the process smoother. Next time, we’d focus on creating original content, posting more product-focused visuals, and using more interactive formats to boost engagement. In conclusion, it was challenging but very valuable.
