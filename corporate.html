            <h2><strong>LOGO</strong></h2>
		  <p> Swan  - Stands for elegance, it is associated with togetherness and harmony, and suits a feminine appearance. The head of the swan illustrates a hockey stick, and the tail represents the hockey ball. These elements are the finishing touch to connect to the brand. </p>
				  <img src="images/LogoWhiteBackground.png" class="small-image" alt="Logo Swan" >
			
		  <br>
		  <br>
			<p><strong>EVOLUTION OF LOGO:</strong></p>

 <img src="images/LogoEvolution.png" class="medium-image" alt="Logo Swan" >
		  
		  <p>We started of with digitalizing the sketch and trying out different color combinations with our brand colors. But, something was still missing. We had an idea to incorporate a hockey ball. So we took the tail of the swan andchanged it to another color, and we made that round like a ball. We think this gives a nice finalized look and story to the logo and pulls it all together. </p>
		  
           <h2><strong>BRAND VISION</strong></h2>
			<p>Life is not just about winning, it’s about breaking past what you thought was possible, setting new limits, and then shattering them again. We want to fuel that drive and to be the reason that keeps you moving forward. Because you were made to break limits, not be held back by them. </p>
			
			<h2><strong>BRAND MISSION</strong></h2>
			<p>Uncomfortable, restrictive gear that doesn’t offer proper protection stops you from pushing your limits. At Modifit, we believe style, comfort, and safety should go hand in hand. That’s why we design equipment that looks good, feels great, and keeps you protected—so you can hit the field with confidence. </p>
		
		<h2><strong>BRAND VALUES</strong></h2>
		<p><strong>Fit the game. Fit the team. Fit you. </strong>-We value a perfect fit to your field hockey experience. With personalized products and optimal protection, you and your team can achieve your best performance. </p>

		<p><strong>Bonds that go beyond the game</strong> - Field hockey is done together, it is about strong relationships that involve teamwork that is an essential factor for success. A team sport demands more than what happens on the field.</p> 

<p><strong>Going above the ordinary</strong> - We strive to give field hockey players the protection, confidence, and strength to perform far above ordinary. Female field hockey has power, and together with our products we go beyond 100% </p>

<p><strong>Play without limits</strong> - Together we reach to the maximum and beyond what you have. We remove the obstacles and we create an achievement to be proud of. </p>

<p><strong>Elevating Standards </strong>-The existing equipment standards are too low, which is why we are reestablishing how equipment should look and feel. It's all about raising expectations and helping players to play with more confidence. </p>

		<h2><strong>FONTS</strong></h2>
			  <p><strong>LORA FAMILY</strong></p>
				  <p>Lora family of fonts, more specifically <strong>Regular Italic Lora</strong>, <strong>Lora Regular</strong>, and <strong>Headline Lora</strong> are clean fonts that are modern but also a bit traditional, and we think it is a perfect match for a quick but grounded sport such as field hockey. It's professional and readable without being too fancy. We believe it adds value to the brand, and from our solution interviews we found that the target audience also enjoys the font. We also chose just one font family for consistency</p>
			  
            <h2><strong>USER INTERFACE PATTERNS</strong></h2>
			  <p>We made use of a grid layout in order to give the website a clean, organized and professional look. For example, team members and product lists are shown in consistent card designs in a multicolumn grid. This makes the information easy to access and easy to compare, in the case of products. The layout is also responsive on the mobile version, shifting from a multicolumn grid to a vertical single column format for better accessibility. 
</p>
		
<p>The layout of our website was built to be simple and functional. We wanted people to quickly find what they’re looking for, especially our shop and products. The color palette only uses our two main colors, the hot pink #F84A98 and neon green.#B2ED58. And the font beig sometimes white or black, for legilibility purposes. We left out any secondary colors to keep the site clean and uncluttered.</p>

<p><strong>NavBar</strong></p>	
<p>The navigation bar is a transparent black, with pink text for contrast. We added our brand name and logo on it to help with brand recognition. It’s consistent across all pages and collapses when you scroll, so it doesn’t get in the way. On mobile, it turns into a hamburger menu, making it easier to use on smaller screens.
</p>
			  
<p><strong>Buttons</strong></p>
<p>All our buttons are pink with white text. They have a hover effect and rounded edges to feel friendly but still professional. The text is clear and calling to action, saying things like “Shop now!” or “Learn More.”</p>
	
<h2><strong>HOME PAGE</strong></h2>
			  
<p><strong>Why Choose us</strong></p>
<p>We placed this section at the top of the homepage because we want users to understand who we are and why we do it right away. The use of a video would have been useful in this section, but unfortunately we did not manage to find one that alligned with our brand</p>

<p><strong>New Arrivals</strong></p>
			  
<p>This section gives a small sneak peek of our products and is meant to get users interested in visiting the shop page.</p>
			  
<p><strong>Contact Us</strong></p>
<p>We included contact options on both the Homepage and the About Page. Our goal is to make it easy for people to reach out or follow us on social media. We want to stay connected and show we listen to our customers’ feedback.</p>
			  
<br> 
			  
<h2><strong>ABOUT US</strong></h2>
	
<p><strong>Vision and Mission</strong></p>
<p>We put our vision and mission at the very top of the page. It’s a big part of our brand, so we wanted it to be seen first. It’s laid out in two columns for a clean and balanced look.</p>

<p><strong>Values</strong></p>
<p>Each value is in its own box so users can quickly understand what we stand for. We made use of bold for headings and regular font for the body of text for design purposes.
</p>

<p><strong>Meet the team</strong></p>
<p>This is the most interactive part of the site. When you click on a team member card, more info drops down in a smooth, simple way. In an effort to keep the design minimal, we decided to make it interactive and have the possibility of hiding information when not needed. 
</p>
			  
<h2><strong>SHOP</strong></h2>
<p>The shop is straightforward. Products are shown right away, with big images and descriptions. We split it into <em>“Popular now”</em> and <em>“All products”</em> so users can see what’s trending or just browse everything. There’s also a big heading with our slogan, to keep things on-brand and make the page visually appealing.

          <p>&nbsp;</p>
          <p>&nbsp;The goal of the testing was to see whether our protoype of our website is cohesive and whether users understood who it was meant for, what it was meant for and how easy it was to navigate. </p>
		  
          <p><strong>TESTING METHODS&nbsp;</strong></p>
		  
          <p>We conducted four user tests, all with women within our target age group. Two of the participants were hockey players, providing valuable insights from that perspective.The other two participants were unfamiliar with field hockey,and we focused on testing how intuitive it was for them to navigate it. Two of the interviews were conducted on campus and two were conducted in a quiet setting outside of the campus. We offered them our laptop with the website open and we audio recorded them on our phone. These are the questions and tasks we used for the users</p>

<h2><strong>TESTING INSIGHTS</strong></h2>

<p><strong>POSITIVE</strong></p>
		  <br>
<li>They liked the color scheme, especially the pink, they felt like it matched the branding and target audience </li>

<li>Understood that the site has a focus on mouth guards and it is about field hockey  </li>

<li>Website easy to navigate </li>

<li>Was able to complete all tasks without difficulty </li>

<li>The content is clearly organized </li>
		  
<br>
<p><strong>IMPROVEMENTS</strong></p>
	

<li>The option to customize the mouthguards is missing </li>

<li>There is no shopping cart page </li>

<li>Prices were not visible on the shopping page</li> 

<li>It was not clear that it was all one size fits all</li> 

<li>Contact part should also be in the ‘About Us’ page</li>  
		  
<li>The video did not align with the mouth guard aspect, and it may confuse the customers</li> 
  <br>
		  
<p><strong>IMPLEMENTS</strong></p>
		  
<p>-We had initially a video on the landing page, under the heading image, that showed a girl playing field hockey. We received feedback that this video might confuse the users since our product page as of now has only mouthguards. We quickly changed it to an image of a mouthguard. Unfortunately we could not find a fitting video with a moutguard that would fit with our brand, so we opted for a photo</p>
		  
<p>-The prices were not visible on the 'Shop' page. We quickly added them.</p>

<p>-It was not clear that the mouthguards are supposed to be one size, due to our vacuum design, so we added a 'one size fits all' tag to the products in 'Shop'.</p>
		  
<p>-The contact page should also be in 'About Us' page. We quickly added it.</p>

<p>-There is no shopping cart page. We did not manage to implement this element in time so this would be a future implement.</p>

 <p>-Customizable Mouthguards option. We did not manage to implement this in time so this would be a future implement.</p>

            
        <h2><strong>How does the website design fit the values and personality of the brand?</strong></h2>

<p>The website feels bold, energetic, and empowering—just like the athletes it's made for. Its sporty design and strong color palette of hot pink and neon green give it a unique and recognizable personality that stands out. These colors, combined with dynamic visuals and clean layouts, create an atmosphere that’s both fun and performance-driven.

The user-friendly structure makes it easy to navigate, while the tone and visuals speak directly to a young, confident, and team-oriented audience. Everything from the images to the product presentation reflects the idea of pushing limits and expressing individuality, which aligns naturally with the brand’s personality.</p>
		  
         <h2><strong>How does the website design fit the marketing and communication strategy?</strong>
</h2>
		  <p>The website extends the look and feel of our Instagram campaign seamlessly—using the same colors, voice, and energy. This consistency strengthens the overall brand identity and ensures that users moving from social media to the website feel a smooth transition in both tone and style.
It supports our strategy by being visually driven and emotionally engaging. Just like our posts, the site emphasizes both team spirit and personal expression. The layout makes it easy to explore the product and also helps turn interest into action—supporting our goals around awareness, engagement, and ultimately, conversion.</p>
		  
		  <h2>How does website design help showcase the unique value proposal of the product?</h2>
		  
<p>The website shocases our unique selling point: our mouthguards with an innovative vacuum system. We have products list around this and on the main page, under 'why choose us', we explain the advantage that we offer compared to other hockey brands.</p>

<h2 id="marketing" class="mt-5">Marketing</h2>

<h2 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h2>
<p>This campaign promotes Modifit's standout product, a vacuum-sealed fully customizable mouthguard designed especially for female field hockey players. The campaign celebrates individuality, empowerment, and team pride while highlighting how Modifit gear enhances both performance and identity on the field. Through motivational content and community-building visuals on Instagram, we aim to grow brand awareness and foster loyalty within our audience. The campaign includes posting 3 times a week, highlighting product details and team moments, and sharing stories according to the content calendar to boost engagement. Through Instagram, we are able to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Build a consistent brand identity visually</li>
  <li>Foster direct community interaction via DM’s, comments, and polls.</li>
</ul>

<p>By April 11th, the campaign aimed to reach the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Objectives:</strong> 100 accounts reached per post</li>
  <li><strong>Response:</strong> 200-250 new followers, 30 likes per post, 5 comments</li>
  <li><strong>Behavior:</strong> Ensure that our followers feel motivated, inspired, and connected to the brand, measured via polls, DMs, or story replies</li>
</ul>

		  <p><strong>TARGET AUDIENCE</strong></p>
		 <li>Female field hockey players aged 16-26</li>

<li>Strong team values but also crave self-expression. </li>
<li>Seek products that reflect identity and boost performance.</li> 
<li>Motivated by community, empowerment, and visual storytelling. </li>
		<br>
		  <p><strong>STRATEGY</strong></p>
<p>The campaign is exclusively on Instagram, based on direct feedback from our target audience during interviews. The participants confirmed that Instagram is their primary platform for content, both personal and team-based which makes it the most effective channel to reach and engage with them.We also explored various reliable resources to better understand our target group and their preferences. Based on both online and personal research, we concluded that Instagram is the ideal platform to promote our brand. </p>

		  <p><strong>COMMUNICATING BRAND VALUES</strong></p>
		  
<p><strong>1.Visual feel:</strong> 
	<p>Bold colours, dynamic action shots, and clean product photography ensure that every post reinforces our identity as a brand that combines power and style. The layout creates a balance between emotional storytelling (team moment, action) and product value (design, customization) </p>

<p><strong>2.Caption:</strong>
	<p>Our captions are intentionally fun, motivational, and energetic. They speak directly to our audience with a confident tone that encourages them to go beyond their limits, embrace their uniqueness, and feel proud.</p> </p>

<p><strong>3.Communicating our values:</strong></p>

 <li>Fit the game. Fit the team. Fit you →highlighted in customizable design content and inclusive. </li>
<li>Play Without Limits → Shared through empowering copy and athletic visuals. </li>
<li>Bonds Beyond the Game → Shown in team celebration shots and community-centred posts. </li>
<li>Elevating Standards → Reinforced by showcasing the innovation behind our vacuum-sealed mouthguards. </li>
		  
		  </p>
<h2 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4">Learning Points</h2>
<p>Key learnings:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Make a content calendar:</strong> We learned that planning content in advance is essential for consistency, reduce stress, and smooth collaboration. This was actually our first time creating and working with a content calendar, and it proved to be one of the most valuable tools during the campaign. It helped us stay organized, meet our posting goals, and maintain a consistent brand presence on Instagram. By clearly mapping our weekly posts ahead of time and preparing them, we avoided last minute confusion and created a better flow of content.</li>
    
  <li><strong>We expected it to be easier:</strong> At the beginning of the project, we underestimated the time and effort required to produce quality content, maintaining engagement, and monitor analytics. This proved to be more time consuming than expected and was a valuable reality check that improved our planning for the future.</li>
  <li><strong>Communication within the team:</strong> Strong communication within our team is very important. During the whole project, we communicated tasks, ideas, and updates. Due to that, our workflow was smooth and successful. We shared the workload between all of us in order to present the best content and engagement with our target audience. One key learning from this was that clear, consistent internal communication directly impact the overall success of the campaign. It helped us stay organized, avoid misunderstandings, and deliver a more unified and polished result.</li>
  <li><strong>Tools we used:</strong> Helpful tools included <strong>Canva</strong> for fast and cohesive graphic design, <strong>Instagram Insights</strong> for tracking performance, and <strong>shared documents</strong> for the content calendar. All of those tools ensured a smooth workflow, consistent branding, and clear team communication throughout the campaign.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="mt-4">What worked well:</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>The content Calendar:</strong> Because of our content calendar, we managed to publish content consistently 3 times a week as planned. This consistency helped with visibility and clear and organized planning and performance.</li>
  <li><strong>Communicating brand indentity:</strong> through consistent visuals and brand voice, we positioned our brand as a bold, feminine, team centred and sporty brand. The post and the captions that we created reflect our values and created a strong brand identity.
    <br><strong>Example:</strong> A quote from an interview with Isabel: <em>“It is clear that it is a hockey brand, I like the name and I like the colors and I really like the pictures, especially the mouthguards, it’s giving a transparent picture of what you guys have.”</em></li>
  <li><strong>Nearly reaching our objectives:</strong> We didn’t hit every objective that we had, but we came really close in most areas especially in reach, follower growth, and overall engagement. This showed us that our strategy was definitely headed in the right direction and resonated with our target audience.
    <ul>
		<br>
		<h2><strong>Our general insights</strong></h2>
						  <img src="images/Instagram_Analytics_2.png" class="medium-image" alt="General Insights" >
		
		<br>
<br>
      <li><strong>Follower Growth:</strong><br>Goal: 200–250 new followers<br>Actual: 164 followers</li>
      <li><strong>Reach per Post:</strong><br>Goal: 100 accounts reached per post<br>Actual: Post reach ranged between 75 and 708 views. Most posts either met or far exceeded the goal, with some reaching over 400 accounts, which was a really encouraging result.</li>
      <li><strong>Profile Visits:</strong><br>Actual: 4,410 profile views in total.  This was much higher than expected and shows that our content sparked curiosity and drove people to check out the brand more closely. </li>
      <li><strong>Post Engagement:</strong>
        <br>Goal: 30 likes and 5 comments per post
        <br><strong>Result:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Static posts: 103 likes and 13 comments across 8 posts (average of 13 likes, 1.6 comments per post)</li>
          <li>Reels: 68 likes and 4 comments across 4 reels (average of 17 likes, 1 comment per reel)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Instagram as a single platform was a strong choice:</strong> Focusing solely on Instagram made our workflow manageable and helped us target the exact platform our audience already uses daily. Based on interview feedback and performance, this was the right channel for this campaign.</li>
	<strong><p>Behavior Insight:</p></strong>
	<p>Following a recent poll conducted via our Instagram Story, the results revealed that 43% of respondents feel motivated by our content, 36% reported feeling inspired, and 21% expressed a sense of connection with our page.</p>
</ul>

<h2 class="mt-4">Best-performing post:</h2>
<div class="col-md-6 p-0">
  <img src="images/Instagram_Analytics_7.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded" style="width: 80%; margin-left: 2rem;" alt="marketing1"/>
	<img src="images/Instagram_Analytics_5.jpg" class="medium-image" style="width: 80%; margin-left: 2rem;" alt="Why Choose Us Image"/>
</div>
<p>Surprisingly, our first reel turned out to be the most viewed content of the entire campaign. In this reel, we introduced our brand name using a trending sound, which likely sparked curiosity about what was coming next. Since it was the only post on our page at the time, it naturally became the main content viewers engaged with. We also noticed that reels in general tend to attract more attention from our followers. Most importantly, this post reached the highest number of non-followers, as shown in our Instagram Insights. This makes it a valuable tool for increasing brand recognition among new audiences.</p>

<h2 class="mt-4">What didn't work as well and unexpected challenges:</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Finding and creating content:</strong> one of the biggest challenges we encountered was finding good content that aligned with our brand’s tone, visual identity, and messaging. Since we didn't produce our original footage, it was difficult to fully capture the unique voice and aesthetic we aimed to present. As a result, we spent a significant amount of time searching through pre-existing visuals and editing them to match our brand’s style. While we ultimately made it work, this experience highlighted the importance of having custom, brand-specific content from the outset.</li>
  <li><strong>Timing issues:</strong> Some posts didn’t reach as many people as we wanted, which we traced back to posting during low-engagement times such as mornings and weekend. We learned that the time and day matter a lot for reach and the engagement.</li>
</ul>

<p>Example: a post we shared at 10:30 AM</p>
<div class="col-md-6 p-0">
  
	<img src="images/Post_10_30_Am2.png" class="medium-image" style="width: 80%; margin-left: 2rem;" alt="Why Choose Us Image"/>
	<img src="images/Instagram_Analytics_3.png" class="medium-image" style="width: 80%; margin-left: 2rem;" alt="Why Choose Us Image"/>
</div>
<p><strong>A post we shared at 20:00 PM</strong></p>
<div class="col-md-6 p-0">
  <img src="images/Post5Instagram.png" class="medium-image" style="width: 80%; margin-left: 2rem;" alt="Why Choose Us Image"/>
	<img src="images/Instagram_Analytics_4.jpg" class="medium-image" style="width: 80%; margin-left: 2rem;" alt="Why Choose Us Image"/>
</div>


<ul>
  <li><strong>Captions or CTAs that didn’t spark interaction:</strong> Some calls to action like “Comment below” or “Tag a friend” didn’t get much response.<br>
  <strong>Example:</strong> on one of our post, the caption was:<br><em>“Strong. Bold. 100% You. Our new mouthguard are here and they are designed by you!🙌🏻✨ Got an idea for the next one? Drop it below and you might score a custom mouthguard — on us!🏑🩷💚 #modifit #playwothoutlimits Let’s make gear as fierce as the players who wear it.”</em><br>Although we called for action, we got zero responds or comments. However, we believe that in the future we would have more time to create bonds with our customers, and by that we would have more interaction with them. </li>
  <li><strong>Lack of behind-the-scenes/team-generated content:</strong> One key element that was missing from our campaign was behind-the-scenes or real-life content. We did not include any footage of our team and the faces that were behind this project. Incorporating this type of content could have added a layer of authenticity and relatability to the campaign, helping followers connect with the brand on a more personal level. In future campaigns, integrating real moments will be a priority to enhance engagement and emotional connection.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Least successful post:</h2>
<div class="col-md-6 p-0">
  <img src="images/Post12Instagram.png" class="medium-image" style="width: 80%; margin-left: 2rem;" alt="Why Choose Us Image"/>

<div class="col-md-6 p-0">
  <img src="images/Instagram_Analytics_1.png" class="medium-image" style="width: 80%; margin-left: 2rem;" alt="Why Choose Us Image"/>
</div>
<p>With the goal of positioning ourselves as a brand that sponsors and supports athletic teams, we created a dedicated post featuring the Dutch national hockey team. This team not only aligns with our target audience but also serves as a strong source of inspiration for them. The post was intended to highlight our commitment to supporting teams at a high level. However, despite the relevance and intent behind the content, it did not perform as well as we had hoped in terms of engagement. </p>

<h2 class="mt-4">What we would do differently</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Create our original content:</strong> Instead of relying heavily on stock photos or mockups, we would film and photograph our own content — showcasing players, team moments, and real reactions. This would boost authenticity and relatability.</li>
  <li><strong>Show more product base images:</strong> While we did include posts featuring our product, audience feedback revealed a clear interest in seeing more detailed and informative content. Followers wanted to understand better what the product is, how it works, and how to use it in real-life scenarios. This highlighted a missed opportunity to educate our audience more thoroughly on the unique features and benefits of our vacuum-sealed, customizable mouthguard. Moving forward, placing a stronger focus on product-specific content, such as demonstration videos, feature breakdowns, and user testimonials — would not only inform but also strengthen trust and purchase intent.<br>
  <strong>Example:</strong> Quote from an interview with Fenne: <em>“I’d like your Instagram but it doesn't really give me information about the product.”</em></li>
  <li><strong>Try to reach more people: To boost reach, we would:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Use stronger hashtags</strong>, for example: #FemaleAthletes 394k posts, #EuroHockey 15.7k posts.</li>
      <li><strong>Tag relevant accounts</strong> for example: female hockey clubs, competitions, famous Athletes</li>
      <li><strong>Follow female field hockey teams/clubs</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Develop themed content series for an example: </strong>“Athlete of the Week,” “Gear Tip Tuesday,” or “Custom Highlight Fridays”. This will build anticipation and routine among followers.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2> Final Reflection</h2>
	  
<p>Overall was this campaign a great learning experience. Without original content, we struggled to fully capture our brand identity, but it taught us how crucial custom visuals are for authenticity. Using a content calendar for the first time helped us stay consistent and organized. Although we didn’t hit every goal, we were heading in the right direction especially for the reach and engagement. Feedback showed our visuals and tone resonated with our audience. Strong internal teamwork and communication made the process smoother. Next time, we’d focus on creating original content, posting more product-focused visuals, and using more interactive formats to boost engagement. In conclusion, it was challenging but very valuable.</p>
	  
	    <h2 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4">Future Planning</h2>

	  <p>Looking ahead, week 5–8 will build on everything we've learned so far in the campaign. Our upcoming content will focus on boosting interaction, enhancing authenticity, and delivering more value to our audience. </p>

<p>One major change is a shift towards Instagram's interactive features, particularly Stories. For instance, we'll use polls like "Do you prefer training in the morning or evening?" to encourage engagement. We're also introducing “Motivational Modifit Monday” to establish a consistent, expected rhythm for our followers. This adjustment directly addresses the lower engagement we observed with earlier static posts and calls to action. </p>

<p>Another key improvement is a stronger focus on product education and demonstrations. A common piece of feedback we received was a desire for more information about the mouthguard and how it works. To address this, we’ll share product demos with swipe-up links and feature a Story with customer reviews. We also plan to showcase more behind-the-scenes content, offering a sneak peek into the design process. This not only educates our audience but also gives them a closer look at the personality behind the brand. </p>

<p>The last four weeks revealed that our brand was missing authentic, behind-the-scenes content, so we’re tackling this by planning posts like “Behind the Brand: Meet the team behind Modifit.” These posts will help build a stronger connection with our followers. </p>

<p>If the project continues, we’d further develop this strategy by capturing even more original footage and expanding our interactive formats (e.g., live Q and As, player takeovers). As it stands, the updated content calendar shows that Modifit is evolving into a more dynamic, community-centred brand that does more than just promote products.  </p>
<h2 id="marketing-4" class="mt-4">Professionalism</h2>
		
We maintained a consistent posting schedule on Instagram, where we posted 3 times a week. What follows is an overview of the posts we've shared, along with the insights gained from each.

<h2>Explanation of the Posts</h2>
	 
<img src="images/Mouthguard.png" alt="Post8Instagram" class="medium-image">

<img src="images/Instagram_Analytics_8.png" alt="Post8Instagram" class="small-image">

<p>This is the first post where we introduced our vacuum-sealed mouthguard. To effectively present the range of design options we developed, we created a carousel format, allowing viewers to swipe through and see the different variations side by side.  This post got 407 views, which results in the photo post with most views. </p>
    
	  <img src="images/Instagram_Analytics_9.png" alt="InstagramPost" class="medium-image">
	  
<p>In an effort to boost engagement with our followers, we launched a giveaway for Modifit gear. The goal was to encourage interaction by asking people to follow our account, like the post, and tag their friends. This approach aimed to create more visibility and involvement within our community. As a result, we received five responses, giving us valuable insight into what types of content motivate our audience to engage. However, we only reached percentage of 1,8 non-followers. </p>
	  
<img src="images/Instagram_Analytics_10.png" alt="Post8Instagram" class="medium-image">
	  
<p>With the goal of positioning ourselves as a brand that sponsors and supports athletic teams, we created a dedicated post featuring the Dutch national hockey team. This team not only aligns with our target audience but also serves as a strong source of inspiration for them. The post was intended to highlight our commitment to supporting teams at a high level. However, despite the relevance and intent behind the content, it did not perform as well as we had hoped in terms of engagement. </p>
	  
	  <img src="images/Instagram_Analytics_11.png" alt="Post8Instagram" class="medium-image">
	  
	  <p>This post was created to communicate and reinforce our core brand value: 'Fit the game, fit the team, fit you.' It represents our commitment to designing products that not only meet the demands of the sport but also align with the identity of the team and the individual needs of each athlete.  </p>
	  
	  <img src="images/Post13Instagram.png" alt="Post8Instagram" class="medium-image">
	  
	  <p>In addition to our regular posts, we consistently shared one reel each week as part of our content strategy. Each reel was created with a clear and consistent vision: to inspire our audience and strengthen the connection between athletic performance and the Modifit brand. The reels feature dynamic shots of hockey players in training or mid-movement on the field, all wearing Modifit gear. These visuals were carefully curated to emphasize both the intensity of the sport and the practical functionality of our products in real-world use. </p>

<p>This format not only allowed us to showcase our apparel in action but also to convey a sense of energy, motivation, and aspiration that resonates with our target audience. On average, the reels achieved around 300 views and approximately 12 likes per post, demonstrating a steady level of engagement. Notably, each reel consistently reached more than half non-followers, indicating strong potential for brand discovery and audience growth through this format. </p>
	  
	  <img src="images/Post14Instagram.png" alt="Post8Instagram" class="medium-image">
	  
	 <p> For our Instagram Stories, we implemented a varied approach to keep our content dynamic and engaging. One key category we focused on includes stories featuring motivational quotes and messages. These are designed not only to inspire our followers, but also to subtly reinforce the presence and values of the Modifit brand.</p>  
	  
	   <img src="images/Post15Instagram.png" alt="Post8Instagram" class="medium-image">
	  
	  <p>Instagram offers interactive features like question stickers, which we’ve used as a fun and effective way to engage more closely with our followers. These stickers create a space for open dialogue, allowing us to directly involve our audience in conversations around our brand, products, and the sport itself. They serve two important purposes: first, they strengthen our connection with followers by encouraging participation and making them feel heard; second, they provide valuable insights into the preferences, interests, and expectations of our target audience. This direct feedback helps us shape our content, product direction, and overall brand experience in a way that stays relevant.  </p>

          <p class="fw-bold">Problem</p>
          <ul>
       <li>Right now there is no solution for the problem of the mouthguard falling out. The only  option there is, is to get a personalized expensive one at the dentist. </li>

<li>Users have the option of buying a flavored mouthguard, however this is a very unknown solution. The flavors that are on the market are very chemical/ artificial. Besides, after wearing this the taste fades away. </li>

<li>Now users can use hot water to mold their plastic mouthguard to fit their teeth. This just doesn't work considering it would never get a full proper fit like it would with a mold at the dentist. Besides, making your mouthguard at the dentist is a really expensive alternative around 150 euro’s.</li> 

<li>Most of the mouthguard on the market are a plain color or a basic design. </li>
			  <br>
 <p class="fw-bold">Solution</p>
		
 <li>With the vacuum system, the mouthguard sucks in while pressing on the bottom on the side. When you want to release the vacuum you have to press again. This way the mouthguard stay in its place and does not fall out during the match.  </li>
<li>Using a paste with a flavor that you put in your mouthguard with a small amount before the match. This way you can have a different taste every match. The paste is based on natural products and therefore not harmful to the teeth, while ensuring a subtle and not a chemical taste.  </li>
<li>The costumer will get a DIY kit at home, to make their own mold from their teeth. This mold will be send back to our company where we can develop a complete fitting mouthguard adjusted to their own teeth. </li>
<li>Offer a broad choice of different patterns and colors, besides there is also an option to create your own design. </li>
			

          </ul>
	  <p class="fw-bold">Customer segments</p>
	  
	<p>Female hockey players, aged 16-26 who care about comfort and protection, and they wish to upgrade their field hockey experience. They value team spirit, they are confident and expres themselves. We chose this age group because they tend to be active on Instagram and they are shopping online often. </p>

	 <p> A field hockey mouthguard that sucks itself onto your teeth with a vacuum system. By means of a small spot on the mouthguard you open a hole to release the mouthguard with air. To make the mouthguard fit we have a small kit to make a mold of your teeth at home, you send this back to us and we make sure your own mouthguard is delivered back to you. 

This is an unique way to provide field hockey players with a perfectly fitting mouthguard that solves current struggles. With this we show our compassionate nature, we stand for comfort, protection, and fearlessness on the field for our field hockey players.</p>

          <h2 id="management-2" class="mt-2">Validation of Assumptions</h2>
          
	  <p>Key pivots based unique value proposition</p>

	  <p>The interviews helped improve the original value proposition by directly addressing the real frustrations and needs of female field hockey players. Players like Linde, Fenne, and Mara highlighted how uncomfortable and unstable traditional mouthguards are, which led to the introduction of a vacuum-fit system for better comfort and security. Emma, Isabel, and Marieke raised concerns about bad taste and hygiene, prompting the addition of a flavored paste for freshness. </p>

<p>Beyond functionality, players such as Isabel, Christa, and Emma emphasized the emotional side of the game. These girls wanted to feel confident and supported as women in sport. This inspired a shift in tone to focus on empowerment, using words like “fearless,” “protected,” and “unrestricted.” Lastly, feedback from Mara, Robin, and Fenne showed a desire for more expressive, fun gear, especially among younger athletes, which led to bolder branding, personalization options, and a youth-oriented positioning. </p>

<p>With the feedback we got through the interviews we refined our business plan by focusing on a clear target audience which went from 11-25 to 16-26. We made a change in the problems we addressed and created a unique and relevant solution. This way we could develop a strategy that aligns with how our target audience truly thinks and behaves. </p>

<p>Conclusion from all interviews: </p>

<li>Christa  </li>

<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Dislikes standard gear, particularly mouthguards and ill-fitting chin protectors. </p>
	 

<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Found flavors more suitable for younger players. Likes customization in clothing/stick wraps, but less concerned with aesthetics at her age (22+). </p>

 

<li>Emma </li>

<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Experienced bad team dynamics, smelly/unhygienic gear, and uncomfortable mouthguards. </p>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Liked the eco-friendly and vacuum-fit concept. Flavors are interesting but she prefers function first. Would pay more for sustainable, longer-lasting products. </p>

 

<li>Philar </li>

<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Emphasized the emotional aspect of team bonding and coaching frustrations. Finds some protective gear annoying. </p>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Not available for a solution interview.</p>
	  

<li>Mara</li>
	  
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Protective gear not ideal—shin guards bulky, mask visibility poor, and mouthguard hygiene is a concern. </p>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Approves of custom-fit, cleaner design. Suggested appeal for younger users. Likes fresh flavor ideas, dislikes synthetic ones. </p>

 

<li>Linde </li>
	  
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Forgetful with gear, finds breathing hard with mouthguards, dislikes yelling due to communication gaps. </p>

<p><strong>Solution: </strong>Vacuum idea could help. Skeptical at first but might try it with peer recommendation. Likes bright aesthetics but not obsessed with gear personalization. </p>

 

<li>Isabel</li>

<p><strong>Problem</strong>: Hygiene and fit issues with mouthguards; goalies need better upper thigh protection. </p>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Likes the brand, colors, and concept. Wants samples and more team-focused branding. Emphasized community and visuals over functionality alone. </p>

 

<li>Fenne </li>

<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Shin guards and socks uncomfortable; mouthguard falls out and loses shape. Safety is a big priority. </p>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Thinks the product is promising but wants to try it first. Not keen on flavors, fears artificial taste. Likes branding but wants more hockey player collabs. </p>

 

<li>Marieke</li>

<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Plastic-tasting mouthguards, uncomfortable shin guards. Equipment aesthetics boost her enjoyment. </p>

<p><strong>Solution: </strong>Would pay more for a good mouthguard. Wants mint flavor. Likes product visuals and offered idea to improve shin guard materials. </p>

 

	  <li>Natalie</li>

<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Fit issues with chin guards and general gear quality concerns. Custom mouthguard is good, but others not so much. </p>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Thinks vacuum idea may be redundant vs. dental ones. Likes customization, especially for kids, but not willing to spend much extra. Wrap idea for sticks is smart. </p>

<li>Robin</li> 

<p><strong>Problem: </strong>She is not available for the problem interview </p>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Loved vacuum idea and sees value in flavour and fun factor. Would want dentist endorsements for credibility. Branding feels happy and clean. </p>
